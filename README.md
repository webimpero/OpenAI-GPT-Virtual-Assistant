# OpenAI-GPT-Virtual-Assistant
This project is a voice assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language understanding and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for generating voice responses. It listens to your voice commands, sends the text to GPT-3 for processing, and converts the generated text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API.
