Voice Assistant with OpenAI and Google Text-to-Speech

This project is a voice assistant that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language understanding and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for generating voice responses. It listens to your voice commands, sends the text to GPT-3 for processing, and converts the generated text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API.

Features:
- Voice command recognition with Google's Speech Recognition API
- Natural language understanding using OpenAI's GPT-3
- Text-to-speech generation with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech
- Wake word detection for starting the assistant
- Customizable voice and language settings

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or later
- Libraries: openai, google-cloud-texttospeech, PyAudio, SpeechRecognition, pygame
- OpenAI API key
- Google Cloud API key (JSON key file)

Usage:
1. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Set up your OpenAI API key and Google Cloud API key (JSON key file) in the code.
3. Run the script and start interacting with the voice assistant.

Note: This project is for educational and personal use only. Make sure to comply with OpenAI and Google Cloud's terms of service when using their APIs.
